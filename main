//Version 2 First try: Tried to implment follow up feature and the abilty to start the program over after the user enters the companys.
//Program is made to help users save time, gather data, track job searches, and notify users if they need to follow up with job application.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


//Goal Setting- More jobs you apply for the more you get noticed.
//Look for a company and then store content from google listings and ask user if thats what they are looking for.
//Resumes Uploaded and to who
//Check cover letters and edit them
//Share resumes and cover letters with friends so that they can see it. This is more personal thats the cache.
//Enter multiple companies or just 1?
//Create x amount of structures based off of how many companies user wanted.
